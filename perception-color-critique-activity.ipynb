    "- **Claim (1 sentence):** The chart communicates the increasing margin of error in Hurricane Laura’s path over time, but it inadvertently suggests the storm itself is physically expanding.\n",
    "- **What the cone *does* mean (in your words):** The cone indicates that future forecasts grow more uncertain over time.\n",
    "- **What people *often think* it means (the common misread):** People usually view the cone as the size of the storm over time, which may lead those outside the cone to have a false feeling of safety.\n",
    "- **Where uncertainty is shown well / poorly (be specific):** It is shown well by the widening of the cone, as it indicates that the margin of error in long-term forecasts are more uncertain over time. It is shown poorly by the solid black border, as it creates a psychological “cutoff” which may imply that no danger exists outside of the cone. \n",
    "- **Color + symbols:** The letters (S, H, M) are categorical (representing storm stages), while the \"Current wind extent\" and wind speeds indicated are quantitative. The red/blue coastal lines are hard to decode because the distinction between \"Watch\" (lighter colors) and \"Warning\" (darker colors) is harder to distinguish on different screens.\n",
    "- **Accessibility:** If the viewer can’t rely on color, the distinction between the “Watches”, “Warnings”, and “Current Wind Extent” is lost in the map/chart. They must rely entirely on the letter icons (H vs S vs M) to understand the intensity of the storm.\n",
    "- **Redesign proposal:** \n",
    "    1. Replace the solid white border with a \"faded\" or gradient edge to show that the storm doesn't end at a specific line/border. \n",

    "- **Claim (1–2 sentences):** This chart makes it easy to conclude that U.S. unemployment is highly cyclical, consistently spiking during or immediately following economic recessions. It frames the current labor market as relatively stable and historically low following the unprecedented volatility of the 2020 COVID-19 shock\n",
    "- **Task(s):** The primary tasks are to Summarize long-term historical trends and Detect anomalies. This supports high-level policy-making decisions or economic forecasting by identifying where the current economy sits within the boom-bust cycle\n",
    "- **Axes + units:** \n",
    "    - Y-Axis: Percent (Unemployment Rate), ranging from 0.0 to 15.0.\n",
    "    - X-Axis: Time in years (1948 to 2026).\n",
    "    - The reader should verify the frequency of the data as monthly or quarterly and account for the seasonality of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Annotations:** The gray shaded regions represent U.S. Recessions as defined by the NBER. A viewer might wrongly infer causality because unemployment often begins to rise before a recession is officially declared or continues to rise well after the shaded recession has technically ended. This is often referred to as a jobless recovery.\n",
    "- **Perception:** The scale is appropriate for trend detection over a 75 year period. However, the compressed X-axis makes it difficult to see small but significant 0.1% to 0.2% fluctuations that matter to economists. Perceived structure is highly dependent on scale and resolution.\n",
    "- **Redesign proposal:**\n",
    "    - Contextual Callouts: Add text labels to major peaks to provide historical context for why a spike occurred alongside when it happened.\n",

    "- **Claim (1–2 sentences):** The viewer will likely compare how CO₂ emissions per person differ across countries over time, noticing that the United States and Russia emit far more per capita than the global average. Another comparison is the long-term decline in per-capita emissions in European countries, while China shows a noticeable increase in recent decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data meaning:** “Per capita” implies that CO₂ emissions are adjusted for population size, reflecting the average emissions of an individual in each country rather than total national output. If totals were shown instead, countries with very large populations, such as China and India, would dominate the chart, making smaller but high-emitting countries appear less significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color + labeling:** Although each country is color-coded, it becomes difficult to identify them quickly when multiple lines intersect or cluster together. Legend hunting occurs on the right side of the chart, especially near the most recent years where several lines converge, making it harder to match colors to countries with similar hues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Perception:** Countries with consistently high per-capita CO₂ emissions, particularly the United States and Russia, stand out because their lines are clearly separated from the rest. Comparisons among mid-range countries can be misleading due to overlapping lines, which may give the impression that differences are minimal when meaningful gaps actually exist, especially given the relatively large y-axis intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessibility:** This chart may be difficult for color-vision-deficient viewers because it relies heavily on color alone to differentiate countries, with several lines using similar tones. The lack of patterns, markers, or direct labels makes some series hard to distinguish.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Redesign proposal:**\n",
    "  - **Highlight + de-emphasize:** Emphasizing key countries such as the United States, China, and the global average with bold colors while fading other countries into light gray would reduce visual clutter and help viewers focus on the most important comparisons. This approach guides viewer attention intentionally, preventing less relevant lines from competing visually with the main narrative of the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Small multiples / fewer series:** Splitting the chart into small multiples by grouping countries (e.g., high-income vs. developing nations) or reducing the number of lines shown would make trends easier to compare and eliminate the need for constant legend hunting. By isolating groups, viewers can more clearly observe patterns and differences that may be overlooked in a single crowded chart.\n"

    "- **Claim (1–2 sentences):** The chart invites the viewer to see that influenza hospitalization rates for residents who are in long term care were very low in most of the season but it reached a peak during week 53. At the end, it is showing that the influenza hospitalization rate is now in a sharp decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing vs preliminary:** The uncertainty is indicated through the gray shaded region covering the final 3 weeks of the season. There was also a subtitle stating that \"Preliminary data are shaded in gray.\" For discoverability, I can say that it was not strongly encoded. The shade is subtle and the explanation is separated from the data points. It forces the viewers to \"hunt the legend\" or read extra details to udnerstand the status of the line. This can lead into an interpretation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Axes + units:** The unit is hospitalization rate per 100,000 residents. The population are the residents of long-term care facilities nationwide. The chart used a common scale or using the unit on y-axis which is the right channel for comparing magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color critique:** The magenta line creates a strong preattentive cue that draw the focus of the viewer to the trend. But, it maintains the same hue and saturation even in the gray shaded region. Using this single hue all throughout the line does not differentiate between final and uncertain data. While magenta usually provides high contrast against white and gray background, it does not use redundant encoding to help viewers with visual needs or those who miss the shading of the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation risk:** A rushed reader might experience an Interpretation Bug. They might see the sharp downturn at the end of magenta line as a definitive sign that the flu season or wave has passed. But they might fail to realize that those final points are preliminary and could be revised upward as more definitive reports arrive. This chart presents a single line that implies false precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Redesign proposal:** First, I will change the magenta line from a solid line to a dashed line once it enters the gray shaded region. This ensures that the data is encoded in the marks itself not only in the background. Second, I will place the text \"Preliminary Data\" directly above the shaded area or near the final data point. This reduces the cognitive load of looking back at the subtitle. Lastly, I will use like a shaded interval around the line in the gray zone to represent potential spread of the preliminary data.\n"

The rate is encoded by the radius/radical line (length from the center), but the eyes perceives it as a area.

    "2. Define a simple color system with consistent tokens across all charts in a project to build visual cohesion and user trust\n",
    "3. Avoid assigning similar colors to multiple lines in a dense chart, as this increases legend hunting and makes overlapping trends difficult to distinguish.\n",
    "4. Use hue only to distinguish categories and lightness to show magnitude, ensuring you add redundant encoding (like dashed lines) so the chart remains accessible without relying on color alone.\n",
    "5. Use distinct textures or high contrast patterns to differentiate distinct categories, this ensures that the chart will remail legible even if the color is monochrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading charts (5 rules)\n",
    "1. Distinguish between physical scale and statistical uncertainty when interpreting geometric shapes, so that the viewers can understand the context of the chart.\n",
    "2. Evaluate the impact of smoothing or moving averages as they can hide significant spikes or invent trends by shifting the timing of data peaks.\n",
    "3. When multiple lines overlap or cluster closely together, meaningful differences can be easily overlooked, so the data should be simplified or separated.\n",
    "4. Audit the visualization pipeline by checking if the axes and encoding support the claim, while specifically looking for preliminary or missing data that could hide the true distribution.\n",
    "5. When reading visualization that encodes linear data that uses radius, this can mislead the reader to perceive area as the main encoding, which scales with radius. This cause large values to appear extreme than what the actual data is.\n",
